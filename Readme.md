# C++ AI
This is a WIP ~~simple~~ Machine Learning AI I am using to learn CUDA and C++->C# integration, as well as develop a better understanding of Modular and Recurrent Neural Networks.
Any tips, help, optimisations or bug fixes would be heavily appreciated, as I am a single 17 year old working on this.
Thank you and I hope you have a good day!\
**This readme will become more detailed soon.**
